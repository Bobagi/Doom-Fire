## Introduction
The Doom fire effect is a visually intriguing animation famously used in the video game Doom. This project replicates that effect using only HTML (with tables) and JavaScript, showcasing how simple technologies can be used to create dynamic visual effects.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: The core logic controlling the fire effect animation is written in pure JavaScript. It manipulates the HTML table to dynamically update the fire pixels, creating the iconic, retro aesthetic.
  
- **HTML**: Specifically using tables, HTML serves as the structure for displaying the fire effect on the web page. Each cell in the table represents a pixel of the fire and is manipulated through JavaScript.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project.
3. Open the `Fire.html` file in your web browser to see the fire effect in action.
